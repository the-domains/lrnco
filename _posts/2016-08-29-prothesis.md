  We have been through a time of dematerialization of our home. The concept of
  home is fewer related with objects and the physical space of the house, and
  more with the memories and feelings that we carry with us. The prosthesis is
  the jewel implanted in the skin, near the heart. It is a system that carries
  our intangible home, containing photos, music, books, magazines, social
  networks, videos and voices of people we love. Just bring it to a screen or
  interactive environment to access this content. The prosthesis turns any
  physical space in a home, filling it with our most emotional memories.
